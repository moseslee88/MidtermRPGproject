##MidtermRPGproject
Our group midterm project - *Connor, Jake, Bryan, and Moses*.

The technologies we will incorporate into this project are....

-Spring MVC

-JPA

-MySQL

-HTML/CSS

We are building a RPG game in our project. We built our schema to include a player(user) table and a groups table, so that it would be easier for us to see the Many-to-One relationship.
